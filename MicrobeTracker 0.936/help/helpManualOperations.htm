Manual Operations

<!-- End replacement block 2 -->

<p>The manual operations tools are designed to manually split, join, or refine
selected cells or add new cells. The controls for these tools are organized into
a panel on the bottom of the main window of MicrobeTracker and consist of four
buttons: Join, Refine, Split, and Add. There tools may or may not update the
lineage data, which depends on whether the Timelapse or Independent Frames
regime is selected (see below).</p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Buttons and their actions</font></b></p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Join</b> - In order to join at least two cells must be selected. The
  program will detect the closest poles of these cells and will try to make one
  cell by joining the poles.</li>
  <li><b>Split</b> - The split regime operates in two modes.
  The first (semi-autmatic) mode is called by clicking the <b>Split</b> button
  and requires exactly one cell to be selected. This mode will determine the
  splitting point automatically by finding the minimum "valley" in the phase
  image corresponding to the cell.</li>
  <li><b>Split + Shift</b> - The second mode is called by clicking <b>Split</b>
  while holding the keyboard <b>Shift</b> button. This mode requires the user to
  pick the splitting point. The cell does not need to be selected in advance -
  the clicked one will be taken. To exit this mode, click outside of the cells of
  press <b>Escape</b>. This mode currently operates only when the mesh is
  available.</li>
  <li><b>Refine</b> - In order to refine cells, at least one cell must be
  selected. The program will run cell detection routine with the current
  parameters taking the current cell shape for the starting point.</li>
  <li><b>Add</b> - Cell addition only works if algorithm 1 or 4 is selected;
  in case of algorithm 1 you have to click on the contour, and in case of
  algorithm 4 on the centerline (the width is then determined by
  <font face="Courier">cellwidth</font> paramerer); to terminate double click or
  press <b>Enter</b>, to cancel press <b>Escape</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Add+Shift</b> - Hold <b>Shift</b> <u>while finishing cell addition</u>
  to call a dialog asking for the new cell number. This number must be a
  positive integer and must not exist on the current or any later frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the manual operations fails, no change is made; otherwise the
program replaces the cells in memory, but <u>does not</u> save them to the disk.
Note that the program in these modes also does not automatically integrate
the signal, which has to be added to the meshes separately (for example, by
running it on the selected meshes in 'Reuse meshes' mode, see
<a href="#Detection">below</a>). To undo the last manual operation, press
<b>Control + Z</b> on the kerboard.</p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Operation in the Individual Frames regime
</font></b></p><p align="left">This regime is activated if the cells on which
the operation is performed were originally detected in the Individual Frames
regime, which is determined by the <font face="Courier">timelapse</font>
attribute in the data structure corresponding to the cells being set to 0
(false). The user can force this regime by adding
<font face="Courier">forceindframes = 1</font> line to the parameter list. In
this regime the frames are treated individually, so every cell is marked as
newborn and no lineage information is kept.</p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Operation in the Timelapse regime</font></b>
</p><p align="left">This regime is activated if the cells on which
the operation is performed were originally detected in the Timelapse
regime, which is determined by the <font face="Courier">timelapse</font>
attribute in the data structure corresponding to the cells being set to 1
(true), and if the <font face="Courier">forceindframes</font> parameter is
simultaneously set to 0 (false) or is absent. In this regime the program will
attempt to reconstruct the lineage history (i.e. their birthframe, division
frame and parent/progeny numbers, see <a href="helpCellNumbering.htm">Cell
Numbering</a> page) of the modified cells and their relatives.
