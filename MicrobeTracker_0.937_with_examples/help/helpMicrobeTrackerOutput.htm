MicrobeTracker saves data in MATLAB format, creating standard .mat files, which 
can be opened with MATLAB without running MicrobeTracker. Among other variables,
it saves the variable <b>cellList</b>, the only one that is intended for the
user. To load a saved file in MATLAB, just drag and drop it into the open window
or use the <i>load</i> command.</p>
<p>The hierarchical organization of the variable is shown in the image above. It 
is a MATLAB <i>cell array</i>, with each <i>cell</i> of the arragy corresponding
to one image frame. Each <i>cell</i> of this cell (subarray) is in turn a cell
array corresponding to a real (that is, biological!) cell. Each of those is a
<i>structure</i> with several fields describing different properties of the 
cell. For example, to access the field "algorithm" for the cell 4 on frame 5 
type: "cellList{5}{4}.algorithm". The fields of this structure are:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>algorithm</b> - the algorithm used to obtain meshes, see Parameters 
  section.</li>
  <li><b>birthframe</b> - the frame on which the cell first appeared in a 
  timelapse. It is equal to the frame number for independent frames.</li>
  <li><b>model</b> - the data set describing the shape in MicrobeTracker units, it 
  is only used by MicrobeTracker to continue detection in timelapses.</li>
  <li><b>mesh</b> - the data set describing the shape in geometrical units. This 
  is a Nx4 matrix (N rows and 4 columns) with the structure shown on the image to 
  the right. The left two rows of the matrix correspond to the left side of the 
  cell, for the x and y coordinates respectively. The right two columns 
  correspond to the right side of the cell. The first row corresponds to the 
  first pair of points (a cell pole), the second - to the second pair of points 
  etc. If the cell is aligned (i.e. its polarity is set either manually or 
  automatically during divisions), then the first row corresponds to the &quot;old 
  pole&quot;, otherwise the vertical orientation of the matrix is random.</li>
  <li><b>polarity</b> - this property indicates whether the polarity is set 
  (polarity=1) or not set (polarity=0).</li>
  <li><b>ancestors/descendents</b> - the list of ancestors or descendents in 
  genealogical order. If a cell divides, one of the two (&quot;mother&quot;) keeps the 
  number, and the other (&quot;daughter&quot;) gets a new one. The daughter keeps the 
  number of the mother, as well as the grandmother, great-grandmother etc. in 
  the field <b>ancestors</b>. The mother in turn remember the names of each 
  daughter in the field <b>descendents</b>. For a more detailed description of
  cell numbering see <a href="helpCellNumbering.htm">Cell Numbering</a> page.
  <img border="0" src="Steplength-area-volume.gif" align="right" width="281" height="237"></li>
  <li><b>divisions</b> - the frame numbers of each division this cell came 
  through as the mother. The daughter remembers only the frame when it split of 
  as <b>birthframe</b>.</li>
  <li><b>timelapse</b> - indicates whether the cell is a part of a time-lapse
  series.</li>
  <li><b>box</b> - the box coordinates (1x4 array with the format: top x, top y, 
  width, height), that includes the mesh inside. It should be used if cropping 
  the fragment of the image that contains this particular cell.</li>
  <li><b>length/area/volume</b> - the length, area, and volume of the cell. The 
  length is the length of the centerline. The area is the area inside the mesh 
  outline. The volume is estimated by assuming the height of each segment is the 
  same as its width and calculated by summing the volume of the cut cones 
  corresponding to each segment.</li>
  <li><b>steplength/steparea/stepvolume</b> - the length, area, and volume of 
  each segment of the mesh inside the cell. the order is from the old pole to 
  the new one when the polarity is set, or randomly beginning from one side, if not.</li>
  <li><b>lengthvector</b> - the coordinates along the centerline of the centers 
  of each segment. The spacing can be different from the default of 1 pixel and 
  the polar segments can be different from the set spacing, thus this variable 
  is more accurate than the number of the row to represent the coordinate.</li>
  <li><b>signal0/signal1/signal2</b> - the calculated signal along the cell. 
  Usually <b>signal0</b> is reserved for the phase contrast, <b>signal1</b> for 
  the  images loaded as signal 1 etc.; those these names can be changed (see
  <b>Detection and analysis</b> section).</li>
  <li><b>spots</b> - unlike the rest of the he fields, this one is added by spot
  dection tools, sych as a <a href="helpSpotFinderM.htm">SpotFinderM</a>,
  <a href="helpSpotFinder.htm">SpotFinderZ</a>, or
  <a href="helppeakfinder.htm">peakfinder</a>. This field is a separate
  structure that contains information about the location and intensity of
  spots detected in a cell. For a detailed description, see the
  <a href="helpSpotFinder.htm#Output_format">SpotFinder help page</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
